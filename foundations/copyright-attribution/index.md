# Copyright & Attribution

## What is Copyright?

Copyright is a legal framework that balances rewarding creators while eventually allowing society to freely use and build upon creative outputs. The core role of copyright is to:
- grant creators exclusive rights to benefit financially from their work
- protect the reputation of authors and ensure the integrity of their work
- after an apporopriate period, revert the created work to the public domain to enable cultural enrichment and ongoing creation

## Copyright and AI

There are two principal ways in which copyright is implicated in AI:
- in terms of AI model training, was the copyright of the authors of the creative works on which the model was trained respected? Did the authors give permission? Were they compensated for the use of their works?
- in terms of the model's output, what is their copyright status? Does copyright vest in these outputs? Does the prompter own the copyright to the work?

#### Copyright in Canada

In order to be eligible for copyright protection the Canadian Copyright Act (Department of Justice Canada 2024) requires that a work must be: 
- an “expression of an idea with an exercise of skill and judgment”
- fixed in some medium
- original (not a mere copy of another work), and
- authored by a “natural person”. (Library of Parliament 2025)
